<h3>Hi there!</h3>
<h2>I'm Alex Neal</h2>

<p>An analytical problem-solver who enjoys turning challenges into real solutions. After several years working in scientific research,
    I've recently jumped into software development, building skills in Java, JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Git.
</p>

<p>I'm now looking for a junior developer role where I can combine my problem-solving, curiosity, and new coding skills to create
     applications that are both reliable and user-friendly.
